# ESP32-CAM-ORIGINAL_FIRMWARE
ESP32-CAM Original full flash dump. Since I could not find it anywhere, [here it is](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0wwafa/ESP32-CAM-ORIGINAL_FIRMWARE/refs/heads/main/esp32_devkit_cam_dump.bin).

If you have any information on what firmware this is, leave a message in the ISSUES section.  
The module is from AI-Thinker.  
On their website you can read:  
  
"**The default firmware is already included in the factory, and no additional download is provided. Please be careful if you need to re-burn other firmware.**"
